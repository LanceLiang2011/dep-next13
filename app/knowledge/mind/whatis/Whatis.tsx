            is a term used to describe a range of abnormal eating behaviours
            that do not warrant the diagnosis of an eating disorder. It includes
            a subset of behaviours that although similar, do not align with the
            diagnostic criteria of an eating disorder. As such, disordered
            eating is a descriptive phrase, not a clinical diagnosis.

            The primary and most significant difference between Eating Disorders
            and disordered eating is they are a clinical diagnosis.

          <p className='mb-3 font-light text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400'>
            Eating Disorders can be defined as a group of mental health
            conditions that involve persistent disturbances in behaviour,
            perception, cognition, and affect. Those who suffer from eating
            disorders experience many disturbances in their day-to-day function
            and the severity and occurrence are much more frequent and severe
            than disordered eating.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-3 font-light text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400'>
            In Canada, Eating Disorders can be diagnosed by a psychiatrist,
            psychologist, or general practitioner based on a set of criteria
            derived from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
            Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) published by the American
            Psychiatric Association (APA). The criteria outlined in the DSM-5
            include behavioural, emotional and weight alterations that affect an
            individual&apos;s physical, psychological and social function.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-3 font-light text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400'>
            There are several types of eating disorders that differ in physical
            and psychological symptoms. The most common types include Anorexia
            Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, Binge Eating Disorders,
            Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, and Other Specified
            Feeding and Eating Disorders. For more information on the different

            Behaviour is how someone acts in response to their environment
            internally; their thoughts and feelings and externally; other people
            and situations. Distorted behaviours are present with both
            disordered eating and eating disorders and impact an
            individual&apos;s actions towards what they eat and how they look.

            Cognition includes all the processes in which we accumulate
            knowledge. With an eating disorder, individuals experience a
            disturbance in their cognition causing inaccurate or exaggerated
            thought patterns such as black-and-white thinking, overgeneralizing,
            catastrophizing, blaming, and negative filtering.

            Affect is the outward expression of our feelings about ourselves and
            those around us through our moods and emotions. With eating
            disorders, an individual&apos;s affective experiences are
            dysregulated which impacts their choices and perceptions of a given
            situation. As such, their ability to function efficiently throughout
            the day is distorted and can result in abnormal behaviours and
            actions.

            Perception is the way we recognize, organize and interpret sensory
            information from external stimuli. The way in which we perceive
            information is dependent upon our unique characteristics and
            experiences and dictates our ability to receive meaningful knowledge
            and act accordingly. An individual with an eating disorder will have
            a distorted perception of themselves and those around them. As such,
            they are challenged to recognize and process the reality of given
            situations.
