          <Paragraph>
            As we know, thoughts (and assumptions) can create an emotional
            response. Emotion is caused by the feeling of a thought or thoughts.
            These emotional responses can trigger more thoughts and assumptions,
            and then ultimately behaviour/action.

            Negative thinking will always be present and different for each
            person. There are several different styles of negative thinking, but
            these are six common thinking styles.{' '}

              Negative Filtering
              <ul className='pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1 list-disc list-inside'>
                <li>
                  As we know, we tend to look at the negatives. This is what we
                  call negative filtering. Negative filtering happens when you
                  only look at the negative aspects of a whole situation or
                  event. You could receive 20 reviews at work about how
                  wonderful you are but tend to only think about the 1 review in
                  which they did not feel the same. Identifying when you are
                  negative filtering can help you understand whether your
                  thoughts, emotions, and feelings surrounding a situation are
                  valid.
